# Fricative-Detection-for-Hearing-Aids
Speech processing and Machine Learning

This repository contains a project that helps in Fricatives phonemes detection which can be helpful for elderly people with hearing aids. A model with 1-D convolutional network has been trained for the same.
The fricatives are high frequency sounds that are tough to detect. Speech processing and DL will help us to solve this problem. 

Another approach to solve the above problem is by applying s-tansform that will be added in the coming days.

Happy Learning.
